# MahShop
This project contains a developed shopping application. It is a shopping simulation which allows you to purchase foods in quantities you wish to have. Once done shopping, you may checkout and view what's in your cart.

## Overview
The menu contains a beautiful selection of Asian cuisine (WARNING: App contains extremely delicious food!). Pick a few and add them to your cart in just a click! When you're done ordering, select a shipping option and head to checkout. You'll be able to see a summary of what you've put in your shopping cart. Shopping has never been made easier!

## Development tools
I have heavily used the Pixel 2 phone (API 28) when developping the shopping application. However, it's been optimized to fit on other phones. I used the Nexus S phone (API 28) to test for optimization.

## Menus
This application contains two menus: the action menu and the list menu.

<b>Action menu</b><br>
The action menu contains the bill icon which lets the user view a summary of what's in their cart.
When trying to view the items they've added into the cart, it often requires scrolling up, down, left, right, you name it. Scrolling all over the place to check and keep track of items can be a real pain (although your finger will get a good workout!). Say bye-bye to constant scrolling and say hello to the <b>view bill</b> feature. Just click the bill icon on the action bar and you will get an overview of the items that are currently in the cart! You will be able to see all of the items along with the amount of that item and the subtotal. Easy, fast and simple! (One reason to use this menu feature on the action menu).

<b>List menu</b><br>
The list menu contains two options: Costs and empty cart<br>
The costs option in the list menu lets you see a summary of all the costs and rates in the shopping application. The summary has a condensed menu of items and their prices, along with shipping rates. All the information is in one place! (Better than scrolling down through the RecyclerView to see the price of each and every item).
<br><br>
The empty cart option lets you clear everything from the cart. Don't know what you put in your cart and you forgot? No worries! Your cart can be cleared up for you so you can shop on a new peace of mind (more convenient than having to reset the quantity count of each item manually)!
